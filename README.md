ErgoDox build system
====================

Fire-and-forget build system for configuring my Infinity Ergodox.

To do:

- Compile only left/right as needed, i.e. move the `.bash` script into the
  shake system
- Configure via Shake config file instead of editing the `.bash`
- Auto-prime the microcontroller for flashing
- Clean target
